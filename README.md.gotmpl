## Magda Project Open Data Connector

![CI Workflow](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-project-open-data-connector/workflows/Main%20CI%20Workflow/badge.svg?branch=master) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/magda-io/magda-project-open-data-connector.svg)](https://github.com/magda-io/magda-project-open-data-connector/releases)

[Magda](https://github.com/magda-io/magda) connectors go out to external datasources and copy their metadata into the Registry, so that they can be searched and have other aspects attached to them. A connector is simply a docker-based microservice that is invoked as a job. It scans the target datasource (usually an open-data portal), then completes and shuts down.

Magda project-open-data Connector is created for crawling data from `Project Open Data` portal.

### Release Registry

Since v2.0.0, we use [Github Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) as our official Helm Chart & Docker Image release registry.

It's recommended to deploy connectors with as [dependencies](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_best_practices/dependencies/) of a Magda helm deployment.
